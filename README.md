# Ransomware-Detection-Using-PE-Header-Information
This project focuses on detecting ransomware by analyzing the Portable Executable (PE) header information of Windows executable files. Using extracted header attributes, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were implemented, evaluated, and compared for their effectiveness in malware classification.

Features

Extracts PE header attributes from executable files and converts them into an .arff dataset format.
Implements and compares multiple models:
Random Forest Classifier ‚Üí 96% accuracyRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) ‚Üí 95% accuracy
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ‚Üí 95% accuracy
Ensemble Model (LSTM + Random Forest) ‚Üí 96% accuracy
Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
Achieves high detection performance, making it suitable for ransomware detection systems.
